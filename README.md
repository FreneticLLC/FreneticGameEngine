The Frenetic Game Engine
------------------------

A powerful C# based 3D and 2D game engine.

-----

## What This Is

FGE is a **Game Engine**. It is the powerhouse behind a game. It takes all the data that defines what a game is (its gameplay mechanics, its artwork, etc.) and turns it into something functional! It does this by providing a powerful rendering system, countless handy utilities a game might need, and direct linkages to a high quality physics engine.

## What This is NOT

FGE is not a **Game**. You cannot play it out of the box. It does not do much just ran empty. For FGE to do anything, you (or any developer) must first create the *content* of the game. This means that everything from artwork to gameplay mechanics must be added by you or a game developer.
