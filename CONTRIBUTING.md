## Pull Requests

For pull requests:
- You MUST: own the code you submit OR it is free/open/safe to use, EG it is in the public domain. Code gathered from within any open source Frenetic LLC project is valid to include here as well.
	- If your code is under any pre-existing license, you MUST note it in the pull request.
- Any and all code you submit is subject to the mini-license below.
- In general, you should confirm your PR is functional in any ways that it may vary.
	- EG if your code adds a system call, it should be tested across multiple operating systems.
- USUALLY, your pull request should fix an open issue.
	- If there is no issue for it, please open one.
	- If issues for it have been closed with a refusal statement, ensure you want to be making a PR at all before bothering with it. Generally, refused issues means PRs are also refused.
		- The exception to this is when an issue is only partially related to what you're doing, or you believe in good faith that the issue was refused on grounds made irrelevant by your adaptation of it.
			- In these cases, please open a new issue.
